# LibraryManagementSystem
The Library Management System is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to manage books in a library. The system provides functionalities to add books, view available books, borrow books, and return borrowed books.
Features:
Add Books

Users can add books by entering the book title and author.
The book gets stored in the library system.
View Available Books

Displays all books in the library along with their availability status.
Borrow Books

Users can borrow a book by entering the title.
If the book is available, it gets marked as "Borrowed."
If the book is already borrowed, the system notifies the user.
Return Books

Users can return a borrowed book by entering the title.
The book status is updated back to "Available."
Exit System

Allows users to exit the application when theyâ€™re done.

How It Works:
When the program starts, a menu is displayed with options:

Add a book
View books
Borrow a book
Return a book
Exit
The user selects an option and provides necessary details (e.g., book title).

The system processes the request and updates the book list accordingly.

The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.
